## 📖 About These Labs

These labs are developed to provide hands-on experience in **computer security** concepts. Through structured exercises, students explore real-world security challenges, vulnerabilities, and defensive techniques.

Here are the currently available labs, which are fully designed and ready for classroom use:

- Intro to SPHERE
- POSIX Permissions
- Buffer Overflows
- Pathname Attacks
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Firewalls

**NOTE:** An active SPHERE account is required in order to use these labs. If you do **not** have a SPHERE account and...
- If you **are NOT** enrolled in a class: You will need to register for an account [here](https://edu.sphere-testbed.net/registration?flow=6c1b4d12-1ae7-4532-8d04-7a677ad2436c), and your account must be activated by administrators at SPHERE.
- If you **ARE** enrolled in a class: Your professor and/or TA(s) will provide you with login credentials and directions with how to use these labs.

## 🎯 Who Are They Made For?

These labs are designed for:

- **Undergraduate (CS 4332) and Graduate (CS 5332) students** at UMD taking Computer Security.
- **Self-learners** interested in exploring security fundamentals hands-on.
- **Educators and researchers** looking for structured security exercises.
- **Industry professionals** who want to sharpen their security skills.

Each lab includes **readings and guided exercises** to ensure accessibility for all levels of learners. You are expected to have some basic knowledge of programming before starting these labs. Additionally, some knowledge in Unix is recommended. If you are not familiar with Unix environments, consider starting with the **Intro** lab.

## 🚀 Goal

The primary goal of these labs is to help students develop **a security mindset** by:

✅ Understanding how real-world attacks work.  
✅ Learning how to exploit vulnerabilities in controlled environments.  
✅ Developing defenses against security threats.  
✅ Encouraging ethical security research and best practices.  

By completing these labs, students will gain **practical cybersecurity skills** applicable in academic research, industry, and ethical hacking.
