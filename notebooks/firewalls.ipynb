    "# <strong>Firewalls</strong>\n",
    "Firewalls are security features for networks designed to accept or reject connections to certain websites and ports. There are two types of firewalls: <strong>Stateless</strong> and <strong>Stateful</strong> firewalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/firewall/firewall_graphic.jpg\" style=\"width: 85%; height: 85%;\"></img></center><em><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wordpress/what-is-a-firewall-and-which-type-is-right-for-you\">Elegant Themes</a></figcaption></em></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>Stateless Firewalls</strong>\n",
    "Stateless firewalls use rules to accept or block connections based on the source, destination, and other predefined criteria, without tracking the connection's state. The <u>state</u> of a connection refers to its status based on the packet sent. More about states will be covered when discussing stateful firewalls. Stateless firewalls tend to be quicker because they use predefined rules to filter information. Since they do not track states, they can be faster and less resource-intensive, making them effective for handling heavy traffic loads. Typically, small companies opt for stateless firewalls due to their affordability. <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/stateful-vs-stateless-firewall\">Because there is usually less incoming traffic than with a large enterprise, there may also be fewer threats.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>Stateful Firewalls</strong>\n",
    "Stateful firewalls are more intelligent because they can track and monitor active connections. There are three types of states recognized by ```iptables```, the tool you will use to configure firewalls in this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "|       State       | Description|\n",
    "|:-----------------:|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| ```NEW```         | A new connection. Has not been seen in both directions (incoming and outgoing). |\n",
    "| ```ESTABLISHED``` | A previously-seen connection. Has been seen at one point going in either direction. |\n",
    "| ```RELATED```     | A different connection, but has been previously associated with a prior connection, <br>like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) errors. <br>These errors occur when the destination tells the source that a packet couldn't be <br>forwarded/delivered. |\n",
    "\n",
    "Stateful firewalls are better at blocking a wider range of attacks, as many attacks can exploit a connection's state and sequences. These firewalls maintain a <strong>state table</strong>, where connections that are new, established, or related are tracked and updated as connections are made. These tables track the destination/source IP addresses and ports, as well as the connection's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we are focusing on <u>stateful</u> firewalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will cover four topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Unix Tools for Networking\n",
    "2. Introduction to ```iptables```\n",
    "3. Basic ```iptables``` Rules\n",
    "4. A Large-Scale Application of ```iptables```"

    "  - Note, ```-p``` stands for \"protocol\". These two should not be mixed up when you begin to make your own rules. You can use either ```-P```, or to be more precise, ```--policy``` also works.\n",
    "- ```INPUT```, ```FORWARD```, and ```OUTPUT``` are the incoming, forwarded, and outgoing packets.\n",
    "- ```ACCEPT``` is the policy of the chain. It tells your system what to do with the chain that preceeds it.\n",
