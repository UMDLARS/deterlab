    "# <strong>Buffer Overflow</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "A buffer overflow is a vulnerability that occurs in programs that handle memory in an unsafe manner. Buffer overflow attacks are commonly associated with C, C++, and assembly languages, which allow direct memory management and pointer arithmetic. Programming languages that permit manual memory allocation are susceptible to this type of attack. Buffer overflows can also happen unintentionally due to programming errors, without any malicious intent. Before learning about this vulnerability, it is important to review the architecture of a computer to understand how memory is managed and how buffer overflows can affect program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, examine this diagram, which is called the Process Address Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/buffer/buffer_overflow_diagram.png\" style=\"width: 20%; height: 10%;\"></img></center></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the parts of the Process Address Space:\n",
    "- The <strong>kernel code</strong> is the communication between the process and the hardware. Like the code block at the bottom of the address space, it does not change when it's running.\n",
    "- The <strong>stack</strong> is memory that is <u>automatically</u> allocated while code is executing. The stack contains temporary variables that the program uses, and is often freed when the value is returned.\n",
    "  - The stack is the \"scratch pad\" for the program.\n",
    "  - Stacks and heaps share the same unallocated memory. There is no reserved amount of free storage that are specific to just the stack or the heap.\n",
    "- The <strong>heap</strong> is memory that is <u>dynamically</u> allocated while code is executing. This memory is allocated when a pointer is created. When pointers are freed from memory, the heap shrinks.\n",
    "  - To remember this: Think of a heap of dirt. When dirt (memory) is added, it grows up in size. Similar to how memory is allocated in the process address space.\n",
    "- Your program's <strong>code</strong> lies at the bottom of this space. This part of the space doesn't get modified when the process is running.\n",
    "  - Constant variables never change, so they lay within the code portion of the address space.\n",
    " \n",
    "It can be confusing to understand why the stack and the heap are separate in the address space. The stack changes much quicker since different functions will clear the stack whenever it's complete, but the heap will need to keep the data for being the function's call. If you would like to read more about why these two types of memory are separate in the address space, check out <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8173353/why-is-memory-split-up-into-stack-and-heap\">this Stack Overflow thread</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>When variables on the stack or the heap grow too much without memory constraints, they will override important addresses that the program will depend on.</u> This is a buffer overflow. A buffer is the amount of space that a variable is allocated, but an overflow is when the buffer exceeds the amount of space that it was allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will contain four topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction/Review of C\n",
    "2. Breaking Unsafe C Functions\n",
    "3. Fixing Unsafe C Functions\n",
    "4. A Large-Scale Buffer Overflow Attack"

    "C is a programming language created over 50 years ago, which was designed to be very fast and efficient. Unfortunately, C can also be a learning curve for students when learning how to program, which can make programs unsafe if students are unfamiliar with unsafe functions. Despite C being an old programming language, it's still useful for modern applications, since there are many benefits that C can provide developers. C is sometimes preferred over C++ because it's quicker, more foundational, and is more portable, meaning that it doesn't contain as many features as C++ when it comes to object-oriented design.\n",
    "\n",
    "C (and C++) is known to be a \"middle-level\" language, rather than a \"high-level\" language. High-level languages are designed to be more human readable, easier to learn, and include lots of built-in libraries to keep code clean, and to reuse what's pre-implemented into the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since C is a middle-level language, this means that it sits between a high-level language and a low-level language (assembly/binary). This means that C provides a mix of being both human readable, and it allows more control of your hardware, which is why pointers are used in C and C++. High-level languages perform these tasks automatically for you, and do not let you manage low-leveled details.\n",
    "\n",
    "C sacrifices security to provide more control over hardware and can run much faster than high-leveled languages because it doesn't focus on preliminary checks. C does not check for memory leaks, garbage collection, array index restrictions, uninitialized variables, and a few more. This is to make the language run as fast as possible."

    "C programs can easily be written in a Unix environment, but C is <strong>not</strong> an interpreted language, meaning that it does not need to be converted into machine code first in order to be executed. Languages like Python and JavaScript are interpreted, meaning that you do not need to explicitly compile them before running them. However, C is a compiler language, which means that you will need to build them before they can be ran. If you would like to learn more about the differences between interpreted and compiled languages, you may read <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/\">this article</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common compiler that developers use for C is ```gcc```, which stands for GNU Compiler Collection. This compiler is already installed on the ```buffer``` node for you, which you will use for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with input and output of a C program, C uses the ```stdio.h``` library, which stands for \"STanDard Input Output\" (stdio). A basic C file looks like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",

    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning 0 indicates that a program is successful. When a program is unsuccessful, it will return 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the template above, navigate into your home directory on your ```buffer``` node. You may access this node by typing ```ssh buffer```. A directory was created and named ```topic_1/```.  Inside of ```topic_1/```, create a file called ```step_1.c```, then write a program that returns a string of your username: ```USERNAME_GOES_HERE```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Your task:</strong> Use the ```printf()``` statement. ```printf``` stands for \"print formatted\", which you will read more about in Step 4. To help you get started, consider searching online for a basic \"Hello, World!\" example, but replace it with your username.\n",

    "- ```variable_name``` is the variable that you wish to print. Make sure that the datatype of your variable aligns with your indicator within ```printf```. Otherwise, you will get a compiler error. Use the sub-bullet above for assistance with how to print specific datatypes.\n",

    "### Step 5: Strings in C\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings in C work differently than other languages. This will be the first datatype that you will use in this lab that can have unsafe behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "All strings in C end with a character called the null terminator, which is ```\\0```. Additionally, strings in C are arrays of characters whose last element is the null terminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a valid string in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char my_string[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\\0'};\n",
    "printf(\"%s\", my_string);\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, this can be very tedious. Additionally, when a string is not closed with a null character, this can occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char my_string[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};\n",
    "printf(\"%c\", my_string[10]);\n",
    "\n",
    ">>  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will be able to read past the end of the string and print something that is either unreadable or is a random character. When printing strings like this without null terminators, accidental data leaks can occur. Printing an incorrectly terminated string will produce unexpected output, such as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char good_string[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\\0'};\n",
    "char bad_string[] = {'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'};\n",
    "printf(\"%s\\n\", bad_string);\n",
    "\n",
    ">> worldhello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```good_string``` and ```bad_string``` are stored next to each other in the stack. Printing ```bad_string``` will print all data up until the first null terminator that it will find. Since ```bad_string``` wasn't terminated, it will keep reading from the stack until it encounters its first null character. Clearly, this is a security vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, C has a shorthand (and safer) way to store strings as variables. Initiating a variable as a ```char``` array will accept a string upon assignment, which will automatically add a null terminator. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char string_var[] = \"Hello, World!\";\n",
    "printf(\"%s\", string_var);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Your task:</strong> Create a C file named ```step_5.c``` inside of ```~/topic_1/```, with an output file named ```step_5```. Then, store your username as a string into a variable named ```username```.\n",
    "- Do not create a list of individual characters like the unsafe example demonstrated.\n",
    "- Do not use pointers (if you know them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Print: ```Hello, USERNAME_GOES_HERE!``` as your final output. Use the variable that that stores your username as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: green\"><strong><img src=\"resources/idea.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Tip:</strong></span> Use the example from the previous step to combine a output with a variable. Use the ```\"%s\"``` specifier, since this is a string."

    "## <strong>Topic 2: Breaking Unsafe C Functions</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions in C are \"unbounded\", meaning that they do not check bounds when they are executed. This is what leads to buffer overflows. These unbounded functions are located in the ```string.h``` header file, which you may read more about <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-library-string-h/\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of unsafe C functions that could lead to a buffer overflow: ```strcpy```, ```strcmp```, ```strcat```, ```strchr```, ```strspn```, ```strcspn```, ```strpbrk```, ```sttchr```, ```strstr```, ```strtok```, and ```strlen```.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this topic, you will be breaking some of these string functions, then learn how to fix them. <u>The functions that you will be breaking are purposefully written inside of a user-defined function.</u> User-defined functions create a new \"stack frame\" within the Process Address Space. All variables and return addresses for this function are located in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>stack canary</strong> is a value that gets placed in the stack, which lies after the variables, but before the return address of the function. If a buffer overflow overwrites the stack canary, the program will detect this alteration and typically terminate the process with an error, such as ```stack smashing detected```. Stack canaries are not located within ```main()```, which makes it more difficult to detect a buffer overflow, unless a segmentation fault occurs or a variable becomes overwritten."

    "## <strong>Topic 4: A Large-Scale Buffer Overflow Attack</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final topic, you will be accessing a nuclear reactor simulator with four different vulnerabilities which can commonly appear in programs written in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <strong>Buffer Overflow:</strong> When more bytes are put into a buffer than the buffer has space for.\n",
    "2. <strong>Off-By-One Errors:</strong> When a counting or inequality issue results in a arithmetic mistake of 1.\n",
    "3. <strong>Integer Overflow/Underflow and Sign Errors:</strong> When the \"wrapping\" of an integer type, or an incorrect sign causes something unexpected to happen.\n",
    "4. <strong>String Format Vulnerabilities:</strong> When a user is allowed to provide a format string to a ```printf``` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already explored plenty of buffer overflow examples, as well as string format vulnerabilities. Off-By-One errors and integer errors are common mistakes that can occur in programming. However, as said before, C does not perform preliminary checks. This means when a small arithmetic error occurs, it may not be detected, and will cause logic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The scenario</u>: Wormwood is a nuclear reactor simulator. Written by an inexperienced C developer, plenty of mistakes are littered throughout the simulator. Many potential issues are present, and all it takes is for someone (either experienced or unexperienced) to use the wrong input, and catastrophe could occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already practice a lot of buffer overflow. These are the other three vulnerabilities that are present in the simulator:\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Off-By-One errors</strong> occur when the arithmetic of a \"for\" loop is mishandled. Here's a common off-by-one error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d \", list[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which prints: ```1 2 3 4 0```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does NOT cause an error. Despite accessing more elements than the list contains. An off-by-one error doesn't occur in just for loops. This can occur anytime that you're trying to access a specific element from an array or a char from a string. The error is most common when indices are not double-checked, since novice programmers tend to forget that indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Integer overflow/underflow and sign errors</strong> occur when a number \"rolls over\" the maximum number of the integer's type. Take a look at this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <limits.h>\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ">> 2147483647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```INT_MAX``` constant is the highest number that an integer can be. Attempting to add one to ```INT_MAX``` will result in this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <limits.h>\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX + 1);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ">> main.c: In function ‘main’:\n",
    "main.c:5:26: warning: integer overflow in expression of type ‘int’ results in ‘-2147483648’ [-Woverflow]\n",
    "    5 |     printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX + 1);\n",
    "      |                          ^\n",
    "\n",
    ">> -2147483648\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer has rolled over, and is now ```INT_MIN```. This is similar to rolling over 999,999 miles on an odometer, where the odometer will read 000,000 as the new mileage because it cannot output 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>string format vulnerability</strong> occurs when a ```printf``` statement is used, but a format (such as ```%s```, ```%d```, ```%f```, etc) isn't provided. When a user provides an input that contains a format specifier, then information from the stack may be shown. Suppose a hacker sends ```%x %x %p %p %s %s``` through user input. This will fool ```printf``` to print two hex values, two pointers, and two random elements from the stack.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 21: Fixing All Vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last step, you are going to fix all of the vulnerabilities that you found between steps 17-20.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Navigate into the OTHER Wormwood directory that's titled ```~/topic_4/wormwood_fix/```.</strong> The fixes to the Wormwood program must be in here so that your previous steps will still pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips to help you figure out where these issues occur:\n",
    "- A <strong>buffer overflow</strong> occurs because the program uses one of the four functions that you broke in Topic 2. Try searching ```wormwood.c``` for this issue.\n",
    "- When you found the <strong>string vulnerability</strong> error, you should've found that the password was displayed when the program printed the username. Find the ```console_printf``` command that does this, and change its format to what you've used in Topic 1. Keep using ```console_printf```. Try searching ```wormwood.c``` for this issue.\n",
    "- The <strong>off-by-one</strong> error can be a little trickier to find. You know which menu option has the off-by-one error. Find the function in ```wormwood.c``` that this menu option uses ```void set_XXXXX(void)```. A comment is made that checks to make sure that a value isn't too high. This will call a function inside of ```reactor.c```, which returns a boolean if a certain condition is matched. Fix the sign that causes the off-by-one error.\n",
    "- The <strong>integer overflow/underflow</strong> error occurs because the bounds are not checked for your payload. You have two approaches to fixing this. The first one is to look in the ```reactor.c/.h``` files and change the parameter type of the function which you're breaking. Otherwise, you may create bounds checks so that this value cannot be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you believe that you have fixed all bugs, click \"Check Work\" below. Your four inputs above will be used in this check, and if all of them do not break the C program, then you pass the final step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: orange\"><strong><img src=\"resources/alert.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Notice:</strong></span> There are intentionally more issues with Wormwood. These can be optionally fixed. Can you see if you can find them and patch them?"
