    "# <strong>Buffer Overflow</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "A buffer overflow is a vulnerability that occurs in programs that handle memory in an unsafe manner. Buffer overflow attacks are commonly associated with C, C++, and assembly languages, which allow direct memory management and pointer arithmetic. Programming languages that permit manual memory allocation are susceptible to this type of attack. Buffer overflows can also happen unintentionally due to programming errors, without any malicious intent. Before learning about this vulnerability, it is important to review the architecture of a computer to understand how memory is managed and how buffer overflows can affect program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, examine this diagram, which is called the Process Address Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/buffer/buffer_overflow_diagram.png\" style=\"width: 20%; height: 10%;\"></img></center></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the parts of the Process Address Space:\n",
    "- The <strong>kernel code</strong> is the communication between the process and the hardware. Like the code block at the bottom of the address space, it does not change when it's running.\n",
    "- The <strong>stack</strong> is memory that is <u>automatically</u> allocated while code is executing. The stack contains temporary variables that the program uses, and is often freed when the value is returned.\n",
    "  - The stack is the \"scratch pad\" for the program.\n",
    "  - Stacks and heaps share the same unallocated memory. There is no reserved amount of free storage that are specific to just the stack or the heap.\n",
    "- The <strong>heap</strong> is memory that is <u>dynamically</u> allocated while code is executing. This memory is allocated when a pointer is created. When pointers are freed from memory, the heap shrinks.\n",
    "  - To remember this: Think of a heap of dirt. When dirt (memory) is added, it grows up in size. Similar to how memory is allocated in the process address space.\n",
    "- Your program's <strong>code</strong> lies at the bottom of this space. This part of the space doesn't get modified when the process is running.\n",
    "  - Constant variables never change, so they lay within the code portion of the address space.\n",
    " \n",
    "It can be confusing to understand why the stack and the heap are separate in the address space. The stack changes much quicker since different functions will clear the stack whenever it's complete, but the heap will need to keep the data for being the function's call. If you would like to read more about why these two types of memory are separate in the address space, check out <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8173353/why-is-memory-split-up-into-stack-and-heap\">this Stack Overflow thread</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>When variables on the stack or the heap grow too much without memory constraints, they will override important addresses that the program will depend on.</u> This is a buffer overflow. A buffer is the amount of space that a variable is allocated, but an overflow is when the buffer exceeds the amount of space that it was allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will contain four topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction/Review of C\n",
    "2. Breaking Unsafe C Functions\n",
    "3. Fixing Unsafe C Functions\n",
    "4. A Large-Scale Buffer Overflow Attack"

Unfortunately, C can also be a learning curve for students when learning how to program, which can make programs unsafe if students are unfamiliar with unsafe functions. Despite C being an old programming language, it's still useful for modern applications, since there are many benefits that C can provide developers. C is sometimes preferred over C++ because it's quicker, more foundational, and is more portable, meaning that it doesn't contain as many features as C++ when it comes to object-oriented design.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since C is a middle-level language, this means that it sits between a high-level language and a low-level language (assembly/binary). This means that C provides a mix of being both human readable, and it allows more control of your hardware, which is why pointers are used in C and C++. High-level languages perform these tasks automatically for you, and do not let you manage low-leveled details.\n",

If a buffer overflow overwrites the stack canary, the program will detect this alteration and typically terminate the process with an error, such as ```stack smashing detected```. Stack canaries are not located within ```main()```, which makes it more difficult to detect a buffer overflow, unless a segmentation fault occurs or a variable becomes overwritten."

    "## <strong>Topic 4: A Large-Scale Buffer Overflow Attack</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final topic, you will be accessing a nuclear reactor simulator with four different vulnerabilities which can commonly appear in programs written in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <strong>Buffer Overflow:</strong> When more bytes are put into a buffer than the buffer has space for.\n",
    "2. <strong>Off-By-One Errors:</strong> When a counting or inequality issue results in a arithmetic mistake of 1.\n",
    "3. <strong>Integer Overflow/Underflow and Sign Errors:</strong> When the \"wrapping\" of an integer type, or an incorrect sign causes something unexpected to happen.\n",
    "4. <strong>String Format Vulnerabilities:</strong> When a user is allowed to provide a format string to a ```printf``` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already explored plenty of buffer overflow examples, as well as string format vulnerabilities. Off-By-One errors and integer errors are common mistakes that can occur in programming. However, as said before, C does not perform preliminary checks. This means when a small arithmetic error occurs, it may not be detected, and will cause logic errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>The scenario</u>: Wormwood is a nuclear reactor simulator. Written by an inexperienced C developer, plenty of mistakes are littered throughout the simulator. Many potential issues are present, and all it takes is for someone (either experienced or unexperienced) to use the wrong input, and catastrophe could occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already practice a lot of buffer overflow. These are the other three vulnerabilities that are present in the simulator:\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Off-By-One errors</strong> occur when the arithmetic of a \"for\" loop is mishandled. Here's a common off-by-one error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d \", list[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which prints: ```1 2 3 4 0```\n",
    "\n",
    "This does NOT cause an error. Despite accessing more elements than the list contains. An off-by-one error doesn't occur in just for loops. This can occur anytime that you're trying to access a specific element from an array or a char from a string. The error is most common when indices are not double-checked, since novice programmers tend to forget that indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Integer overflow/underflow and sign errors</strong> occur when a number \"rolls over\" the maximum number of the integer's type. Take a look at this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <limits.h>\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ">> 2147483647\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```INT_MAX``` constant is the highest number that an integer can be. Attempting to add one to ```INT_MAX``` will result in this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <limits.h>\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX + 1);\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    ">> main.c: In function ‘main’:\n",
    "main.c:5:26: warning: integer overflow in expression of type ‘int’ results in ‘-2147483648’ [-Woverflow]\n",
    "    5 |     printf(\"%d\", INT_MAX + 1);\n",
    "      |                          ^\n",
    "\n",
    ">> -2147483648\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer has rolled over, and is now ```INT_MIN```. This is similar to rolling over 999,999 miles on an odometer, where the odometer will read 000,000 as the new mileage because it cannot output 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another similar example of an integer overflow is an occurrence back in 2020. An Android user took an image of St. Mary Lake in Glacier National Park, but accidentally captured a color which would not be readable in a standard RGB (sRGB) code. The RGB value of a specific pixel was 257, which was more than the maximum, which was 255. Since Android phones would not be able to process this \"color\", they would crash if they ever loaded the image onto their device. <a href=\"https://nokiamob.net/2020/06/09/explained-why-this-photo-crashes-some-android-phones/\">You may read more about this here.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>string format vulnerability</strong> occurs when a ```printf``` statement is used, but a format (such as ```%s```, ```%d```, ```%f```, etc) isn't provided. When a user provides an input that contains a format specifier, then information from the stack may be shown. Suppose a hacker sends ```%x %x %p %p %s %s``` through user input. This will fool ```printf``` to print two hex values, two pointers, and two random elements from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
