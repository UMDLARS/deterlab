    "# <strong>SQL Injection</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) injection (abbreviated as SQLi) is a type of database attack by typing SQL code into an input field. SQL injection attacks can be very detrimental, as they can be used to leak information, change entries, wipe entire databases, and more. For this lab, you will be experimenting with a bank website that contains insecure code that does not sanitize user input, opening it up to security vulnerabilities.\n",

    "The website where you will practice SQL injection is developed in PHP, which is hosted through Apache. PHP is a server-side language that's used for handling and processing data for websites. Since PHP is server-side, its code cannot be viewed by the user. However, this does not prevent attackers from attemping SQL injection, and you will learn in this lab how hackers can guess-and-check various SQL statements to crack a database.\n",

Non-relational DBMS's exist, which is where data are stored as document files. An example of a non-relational DBMS is MongoDB. There are a few different variations of SQL which you may find online. A couple that you may find are MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MariaDB. These all use SQL, but may have feature and performance differences. \n",

MariaDB is designed to have more features, better performance, and fewer bugs than MySQL, and it's also more scalable and has faster query speeds. MariaDB has <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-mysql-and-mariadb/\">several extra features</a>, such as ```CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE``` and JSON query support. These features are advanced, and will not be covered in the lab.\n",

Each attribute has a type to them, similar to programming languages like C. Additionally, it's common for tables to have keys to them, which are unique identifiers for each entry. There are multiple types of keys, but we are going to use a ```PRIMARY KEY``` for the ```student_id``` attribute. A ```PRIMARY KEY``` is unique and cannot be a duplicate value. There are also candidate keys, super keys, alternate keys, foreign keys, and composite keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the layout of the table that you will create:\n",
    "- ```student_id``` is of type ```SMALLINT UNSIGNED``` and a ```PRIMARY KEY```.\n",
    "  - ```SMALLINT``` ranges between -32,768 to 32,767.\n",
    "  - ```UNSIGNED``` takes the size of ```SMALLINT```, but only consists of positive values. Therefore, it will range from 0 to 65,535. We are using ```UNSIGNED``` so that there are no negative ID values.\n",
    "  - <u>Note</u>: ```UNSIGNED``` is unsupported in PostgreSQL.\n",
    "- ```student_name``` is of type ```VARCHAR(64)```\n",
    "  - ```VARCHAR``` means \"VARiable CHARacter\", which dynamically allocates alphanumeric characters up to 64 characters.\n",
    "  - This allows ```student_name``` to be 10 bytes in length if it's 10 characters long, up to 64 characters.\n",
    "- ```student_grade``` is of type ```CHAR(1)```\n",
    "  - ```CHAR``` is a fixed length of characters.\n",
    "  - ```CHAR(15)``` will always take 15 bytes in memory, even if the string is not 15 characters long itself, like the word \"database\".\n",
    "  - ```CHAR(1)``` is being used since students will be allocated a grade of A, B, C, D, or F.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```CREATE TABLE``` query can be lengthy, depending on the table. It consists of the following syntax: ```CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the following columns and datatypes, create a table called ```students``` that has the following:\n",
    "- ```student_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY```\n",
    "- ```student_name VARCHAR(64)```\n",
    "- ```student_grade CHAR(1)```"

    "To add SQL entries into the table, use the ```INSERT INTO``` command. The syntax is: ```INSERT INTO table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (A, B, ...);```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the following entries that you will need to add into the table:\n",
    "- ID: 100, Name: Aaron, Grade: A\n",

    "- ID: 102, Name: Hannah, Grade: D\n",
    "- ID: 103, Name: Abby, Grade: NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of the ```column1, column2, ...``` attributes must match the type of the ```VALUES```. For example, inserting an ```INT``` datatype does not require quotes, but ```CHAR``` or ```VARCHAR``` require quotes around them (similar to strings in programming languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the entries contains a ```NULL``` value. SQL allows ```NULL``` values, which are not equal to ```0``` or ```\"NULL\"```. NULL is not a string, it's a datatype.\n",

    "Add the four entries to the ```students``` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Tips<u>:\n",
    "- Order does not matter when using ```INSERT INTO```. If you created your table as ```student_id```, ```student_grade```, then ```student_name```, you may use ```INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name, student_grade), VALUES (...)```, where ```student_name``` and ```student_grade``` are in opposite order.\n",
    "- Not all DBMS's support double quotes. Some SQL modes only support single quotes. Fortunately, MariaDB supports both single quotes and double quotes. Backticks (``` ` ```) can be used to identify columns, though this is optional. However, it may be required if you make a (poor) decision naming an attribute after a reserved keyword, like ``` `column` ```.\n",
    "- As emphasized before, ```NULL``` is not a string. Consider this when adding your fourth entry."

    "This function requires a connection to be made with the SQL server, which can provide undefined behavior if a connection isn't made before the function is called. This function takes any unsafe characters that can occur within a SQL statement, and safely escapes characters so that it treats SQL tokens as regular string characters. However, there are security vulnerabilities to this statement, which you can <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5741187/sql-injection-that-gets-around-mysql-real-escape-string\">read about here</a>. \n",

    "\n",
    "The safer alternative of ```mysqli_real_escape_string()``` is ```mysqli_prepare()```, which is a <u>prepared statement</u>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prepared statement is a pre-compiled query, which means that it's sent to the database before it takes input. Once it has been compiled, the user input is replaced by ```?``` within the query, and becomes impossible to inject SQL code into. Prepared statements take the input type for each ```?``` within the query, and their types get checked when compiling the code before replacing the ```?``` with the user's input.\n",
    "\n",

    "```$stmt = mysqli_prepare(conn, \"INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)\");```\n",

    "Before a statement can be executed, you need to bind parameters to the ```?``` values in the prepared statement. This tells PHP which variables are being assigned to the question marks in the statement. So, the next line would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, 'ss', $userInput1, $userInput2);```\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to run ```mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);``` to execute the statement. <u>This is not specific to prepared statements, and is already written for you in the exercises.</u> If your SQL query returns a row from a table, it can be retrieved with ```$result = mysqli_stmt_get_result($stmt);```, then you can convert the result into an array with ```$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result);```.

    "a) <u>You cannot have more than one query in a statement when executing from PHP.</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "Correct! When not using prepared statements, the ```query()``` statement is being used. However, if you want to execute multiple queries within one statement, you need to use ```mysqli_multi_query()```. Source: https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.multi-query.php\n",
    "\n",
    "b) <u>A ```SELECT``` statement cannot be nested with a ```INSERT``` or ```UPDATE``` statement.</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect. Multiple queries can be called together, no matter their behavior. They can be separated with semicolons, and it's still a valid SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) <u>```fccu.php``` needs to read output from the SQL statement, and ```INSERT``` or ```UPDATE``` provides no output. So, the statement(s) cannot be used.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect. Although ```INSERT``` and ```UPDATE``` return zero rows, it will still be a valid query. If such an attack worked, returning zero rows would likely produce a \"User Not Found\" error, but insertion/updating would still happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) <u>The ID field restricts the number of characters you can type, and doing an insertion would max out the character limit.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorrect. The ID field allows an unlimited amount of characters. However, not restricting the ID field is a security vulnerability, as well as allowing characters instead of just numbers."
