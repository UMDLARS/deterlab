    "# <strong>SQL Injection</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) injection (abbreviated as SQLi) is a type of database attack by typing SQL code into an input field. SQL injection attacks can be very detrimental, as they can be used to leak information, change entries, wipe entire databases, and more. For this lab, you will be experimenting with a bank website that contains insecure code that does not sanitize user input, opening it up to security vulnerabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "The website where you will practice SQL injection is developed in PHP, which is hosted through Apache. PHP is a server-side language that's used for handling and processing data for websites. Since PHP is server-side, its code cannot be viewed by the user. However, this does not prevent attackers from attemping SQL injection, and you will learn in this lab how hackers can guess-and-check various SQL statements to crack a database.\n",

    "For the first topic, you are going to learn the basics of SQL, such as creating a database, a table, and practicing queries like adding, updating, and deleting entries from the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before practicing SQL, some important background and setup. SQL is a relational database management system (DBMS), meaning that data is stored as tables. Non-relational DBMS's exist, which is where data are stored as document files. An example of a non-relational DBMS is MongoDB. There are a few different variations of SQL which you may find online. A couple that you may find are MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and MariaDB. These all use SQL, but may have feature and performance differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is going to use MariaDB, which is backwards compatible with MySQL. This means that applications that use MySQL can easily switch to MariaDB without losing performance or features. MariaDB is designed to have more features, better performance, and fewer bugs than MySQL, and it's also more scalable and has faster query speeds. MariaDB has <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-mysql-and-mariadb/\">several extra features</a>, such as ```CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE``` and JSON query support. These features are advanced, and will not be covered in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may view documentation called <a href=\"https://mariadb.com/kb/en/incompatibilities-and-feature-differences-between-mariadb-10-5-and-mysql-8-/\">Incompatibilities and Feature Differences Between MariaDB 10.5 and MySQL 8.0</a> if you would like to learn more about MariaDB and how it's different from MySQL."

There are multiple types of keys, but we are going to use a ```PRIMARY KEY``` for the ```student_id``` attribute. A ```PRIMARY KEY``` is unique and cannot be a duplicate value.

SQL allows ```NULL``` values, but these are not equal to ```0``` or ```\"NULL\"```. <strong>```NULL``` is not a string</strong>. ```NULL``` is a variable itself to describe \"no data\".

    "\n",
    "In the previous step, you should've observed the security vulnerability with this PHP code. From Step 10, you observed that typing a valid student ID works, but there is are some security issues with this setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Your task:</strong> Using this to your advantage, type SQL code into the \"Student ID\" field on the website to change Aaron's name to Taylor. \n",
    "\n",
    "After testing your statement, you will need to copy/paste your input into the field below to check your work. Your database will be reset and your query will be tested to determine if your SQL statement is correct. If you would like to reset your database, you may click on the \"Reset\" button, similar to Section 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>If you're lost with where to begin</u>, look at the ```$sql``` variable in the source code: ```SELECT student_id, student_name, student_grade FROM students WHERE student_id = $student_id```. Understand that ```$student_id``` is the value from the input field. Consider this: ```student_id``` needs to be equal to something, but if you use ```OR``` in your statement, then typing another comparison that's <u>always</u> true will create no filtering. Thus, printing everything from ```students```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: green\"><strong><img src=\"resources/idea.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Tip:</strong></span> If you haven't already, try a very basic SQL injection that prints all database entries in the table. If you know how to do this basic SQL injection attack, you can end it with a ```;```, then type in the payload that will change Aaron to Taylor. This works because the PHP file is using ```mysqli_multi_query```, which allows you to process multiple SQL queries in one statement. The PHP file is setup like this so that you can run an ```UPDATE``` command within your payload. If ```mysqli_query``` were to be used instead, your payload would not work. It would only accept one SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red;\"><strong><img src=\"resources/alert.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Warning:</strong></span> When you perform your SQL injection attack, your ```UPDATE``` statement comes after a ```SELECT``` statement, which prints your table. This means that your changes <u>will not appear reflected until you run another ```SELECT``` statement.</u> If you think your payload worked, try running your payload again to see if your database updated. Or, check your database within MySQL on ```sqli``` to see if the database updated."

    "### mysqli_real_escape_string() - <em style=\"color: red;\">Unsafe</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is a function called ```mysqli_real_escape_string()```, which is an <strong>unsafe</strong> sanitization function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function requires a connection to be made with the SQL server before it can be called. This function takes any unsafe characters that can occur within a SQL statement, and safely escapes characters so that it treats SQL tokens as regular string characters. However, there are security vulnerabilities to this statement, which you can <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5741187/sql-injection-that-gets-around-mysql-real-escape-string\">read about here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "To put simply, this function becomes unsafe if your database character set does not match your PHP character set. This means using double quotes for your SQL statement, but single quotes for your user input, or vice versa, can break your security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### mysqli_prepare() - <em style=\"color: green;\">Safe</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "The safer alternative of ```mysqli_real_escape_string()``` is ```mysqli_prepare()```, which is a <strong>prepared statement</strong>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prepared statement is a pre-compiled query, which means that it's sent to the database before it takes input. Once it has been compiled, the user input is replaced by ```?``` within the query, and becomes impossible to inject SQL code into. Prepared statements take the input type for each ```?``` within the query, and their types get checked when compiling the code before replacing the ```?``` with the user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a prepared statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```$stmt = $conn->prepare(\"INSERT INTO table (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)\");```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a statement can be executed, you need to bind parameters to the ```?``` values in the prepared statement. This tells PHP which variable types are being assigned to the question marks in the statement. So, the next line would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```$stmt->bind_param('ss', $userInput1, $userInput2);```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```ss``` tells SQL that ```$userInput1``` is a string, as well as ```$userInput2```. Additionally, if any inputs are an ```i``` type, it tells SQL that you are sending an int, ```d``` is a float, and ```b``` is a blob. You only need to worry about ```i``` and ```s``` for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the last step is to run ```$stmt->execute();``` to execute the statement. If your SQL query returns a row from a table, it can be retrieved with ```$result = $stmt->get_result();```, then you can convert the result into an array with ```fetch_row``` or ```fetch_array```. Place this statement within a ```while``` loop if you would like to read all rows from the query."
