    "# <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an injection attack where hackers deliver a JavaScript payload to execute malicious code whenever someone visits a website. These types of attacks are common on websites that have message boards or comments. There are three types of XSS attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/xss/xss_example.jpg\" style=\"width: 75%; height: 75%;\"></img></center><em><figcaption>Credit: <a href=\"https://spanning.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-web-based-application-security-part-3/\">Spanning</a></figcaption></em></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Reflected XSS</strong> is where JavaScript is injected through an HTTP request. A website that uses CGI (Common Gateway Interface) retrieves parameters through the address bar of a browser. A reflected XSS attack injects HTML or JavaScript into an HTTP request, then tampers with the page that gets rendered to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example from <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting\">PortSwigger</a>: \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the site is accessed, it will render: ```<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```<script>``` tag will execute any JavaScript code that the hacker wishes to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Stored XSS</strong> is an attack where injected JavaScript is stored on a website by an attacker. For this lab, you will be working with stored XSS payloads. When message boards don't sanitize a user's input, a hacker can write an attack containing ```<script>```, which gets executed whenever that webpage is visited by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>DOM-Based XSS</strong> is an attack similar to reflected XSS attacks, but does not utilize HTTP requests when delivering the payload. Rather than using CGI parameters, a DOM-Based attack does not send data to the server, and the attack is entirely client-side. These attacks are difficult to differentiate from reflected XSS attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will contain four topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTTP Protocols\n",
    "2. Session Hijacking\n",
    "3. PHP Sessions and ```document.cookie```\n",
    "4. A Large-Scale Application of Cross-Site Scripting"

    "A <strong>```POST```</strong> request consists of sending data to a website, to which it becomes processed by the server. ```POST``` should not be confused with ```PUT```, where ```PUT``` is mainly used for replacing or updating a certain resource on a server. ```PUT``` requires a specific Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), meaning you must specify the exact path and resource that you want to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of a ```POST``` request is submitting a form on a website. The website identifies specific names for each field, like name, email, or an \"accept\" checkbox. Then, when the user ```POST```s the information by clicking submit, the server assigns those names with specific values that the user provided on the form, then processes the information, like adding the values to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>```GET```</strong> request gathers a resource from a server. ```GET``` variables are easy to determine from a PHP website, as they appear in the URL of a website. A ```GET``` variable can be obtained by observing a ```?``` after a ```.php``` extension in the URL, then each subsequent name with a ```=``` is the name and value of each ```GET``` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: ```https://www.testwebsite.com/index.php?name=umdclassXXXX&age=21```, where ```name``` is umdclassXXXX and ```age``` is 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ```telnet``` installed, you can call a ```GET``` request for the landing page of any website. Simply type ```telnet url 443``` to call an HTTPS request for any provided URL, then type ```GET /``` to get the HTML source code for the landing page of the website.\n",

    "## <strong>Topic 3: PHP Sessions and ```document.cookie```</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>PHP Sessions</strong>\n",
    "PHP is a server-side language used in web development. PHP handles back-end development tasks such as executing SQL queries for databases, managing transactions, saving data to storage containers, and much more. For this lab, we are focusing on some important concepts for handling user information: sessions and cookies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Sessions</strong> are stored on a server and expire when the browser is closed. Sessions are generally safer and store data for a shorter duration. However, they do not make you invulnerable, as you will discover later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Cookies</strong> are stored on the client's browser and have a set expiration time. Cookies are stored as text files, which the browser retrieves when a website requests them. You can view where your browser stores cookies and examine their contents. A hacker can retrieve cookies in the same way that you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Side note:</em> The European Union requires websites to be GDPR compliant if they use cookies, which is one of the strictest privacy and security laws in the world. If you are interested in reading more about cookies and the GDPR regulation, you can read more <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/cookies/\">here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clear that cookies are not intended for storing private data. A safer alternative to cookies is sessions. However, cookies can still be used for storing data that is meant to be public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions and cookies are superglobal variables in PHP, meaning they are accessible across all PHP files on a server. However, a PHP file must \"activate\" a session by using ```session_start()```. They are accessed using ```$_SESSION[\"key\"] = value;``` or ```$_COOKIE[\"key\"] = value;```. Before using sessions in PHP, you must call ```session_start()```. Sessions can be manually ended by using ```session_destroy()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>```document.cookie```</strong>\n",
    "The ```document.cookie``` property is a <strong>JavaScript</strong> property. JavaScript is a language used in browsers, which means you can debug websites that use JavaScript directly from your browser. Each browser is different, but generally, you can access the console by following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Right-click on a webpage (this does not work on all webpages, such as JupyterLab).\n",
    "- Navigate to \"Inspect Element\" or \"Inspect\".\n",
    "- Select the \"Console\" tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ```document.cookie``` is a property, you can simply type ```document.cookie``` into the console to view its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever PHP sets a session variable, the user is assigned a value called ```PHPSESSID```. Although session variables are stored on the server, the session ID must be stored in the browser, typically as a cookie named ```PHPSESSID```. When a request is made to the server, it uses this session ID to identify the corresponding session, retrieve the associated variables, and make them available to that user. These session variables cannot be accessed by anyone else unless they have your session ID."

    "\n",
    "The developers of the notes website has now moved to another project called Sloth's Unlimited. After learning about the security vulnerability on their previous website, they decided to design a new website with more added security. In hopes of avoiding another security exploit, they asked you to try breaking the website with your knowledge in cross-site scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>You are strongly encouraged to read about the outline of the website before continuing to the first step in this topic.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three nodes in this lab: ```client```, ```server```, and ```teshwan```.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ```server``` node hosts the website. This is the node where all of the PHP files are stored, and this is the node that you will be using for the rest of the lab.\n",
    "- The ```client``` node is where your notebook is accessing the website from. The ```client``` is the root user of the website, which holds the cookie that you wish to steal.\n",
    "- The ```teshwan``` node is Lord Teshwan's computer. Teshwan is a developer for Sloth's Unlimited. Teshwan's computer is infected with a file called ```steal.php```, which he doesn't know about. However, you know about this infected file. This file accepts a cookie for a GET parameter. Recall from Topic 1 that GET parameters are variables that are accessed from the URL of the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the following IP addresses that will be important to know for the lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Nodes:        | ```client```   | ```server```   | ```teshwan```  |\n",
    "|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| IP Addresses: | ```10.0.1.1``` | ```10.0.1.2``` | ```10.0.1.3``` |\n",
    "\n",
    "On the website, you will need to create an account to sign into the forum. Once an account is made, you may begin posting. You may choose whatever topic that you would like to post on, or create your own topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "```client```, ```server```, and ```teshwan``` are on the same network, which means that you can call requests to access each other's web files by using cURL requests (not required for the lab). This is the topology of the XSS lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure><center><img src=\"resources/xss/topology.png\" style=\"width: 25%; height: 25%;\"></img></center></figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Here is the ultimate goal of the following few steps:</u> You are going to write a payload script that ```client``` will access whenever you click \"Check Payload\". Since ```steal.php``` is a web file that's stored in ```/var/www/html``` on ```teshwan```'s node, you will need to write a payload that will redirect ```client``` to ```http://10.0.1.3/steal.php?cookie=COOKIE_VALUE```. This is Teshwan's IP address, which is accessible by ```client```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Here are some important considerations when writing your payload</u>:\n",
    "- You only need to access the ```server``` node for the remainder of the lab, like you have been doing already.\n",
    "  - If you haven't already, you will need to port forward from the ```server``` node. Do not port forward from other nodes or a ```xss``` node. An ```xss``` node doesn't exist.\n",
    "- Using an ```POST``` request will not work. It must be ```GET```. More on this is below.\n",
    "- The ```COOKIE_VALUE``` is the entirety of ```document.cookie``` in JavaScript. You are not required to split the variable or use regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Why will a POST request not work?</strong> Secure websites use CORS, which stand for \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\". CORS is a security feature built into a browser that will prevent images, videos, files, and more, from being shared across different websites. CORS prevents random websites from using your API to intiate POST requests without being on your website. This means making POST requests to other domains (or IP addresses, in this case) are blocked. The reason why a POST request worked in the first section is because all POST requests were made within the same domain of the website. Since there are three different IP addresses, with an infected payload running on a different IP from the ```server```, CORS will prevent ```client``` from calling something on ```teshwan```'s IP address. Instead, we must redirect ```client``` to ```teshwan```'s IP address and force ```client``` to call a malicious script."

The ```10.0.1.3``` IP address is Lord Teshwan's computer, which the ```client``` node has access to.\n",

However, when YOU access the infected page, it will not execute your payload. ```10.0.1.3``` is not an accessible IP address on your computer, so your web browser is not redirecting you to this domain. It's only accessible through ```client``` (this notebook) and the ```server```. This is ```teshwan```'s IP address."

    "### Step 11: Using PHP's Built-In ```htmlspecialchars()``` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous few steps, you should be able to observe that creating an effective sanitization function is difficult, and should be avoided. Fortunately, PHP contains a built-in function that is used for escaping dangerous characters, named ```htmlspecialchars()```. This function takes a string for an input, and replaces all unsafe characters with escape characters to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may read the ```htmlspecialchars()``` documentation <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>While you worked throughout this topic</strong>, the notebook was automatically uncommenting and commenting out the sanitization functions that you saw above. These functions are all located in a PHP file named ```sanitize.php```, which every message gets sent through as they're rendered on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open ```/var/www/html/sanitize.php```, and go to the bottom of the file. You should view a function that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/*** Your Routine Here ***/\n",
    "/**\n",
    "function sanitize($string) {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "*/\n",
    "/*************************/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is currently commented out. You may leave it either commented or uncommented. The \"Check Payload\" button at the bottom will automatically uncomment it if you forgot to do it yourself. After uncommenting, it should appear as this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/*** Your Routine Here ***/\n",
    "function sanitize($string) {\n",
    "\n",
    "}\n",
    "/*************************/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a sanitization function using ```htmlspecialchars()```. Then, using a payload that you previously used from Steps 7-9, test out your payload, then click \"Check Payload\". The admin will access every page on the forum. If the Eagles category doesn't get created, then you pass the step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: green\"><strong><img src=\"resources/idea.png\" style=\"width: 12px\"> Tips:</strong></span> \n",
    "- The first function you broke from Step 7 provides a very close function to what you need to write. Consider using this payload, then call ```htmlspecialchars()``` onto the string.\n",
    "- One of your sanitization routines is probably already uncommented. You may leave it uncommented, as <u>the notebook will automatically comment it out for you.</u>"
