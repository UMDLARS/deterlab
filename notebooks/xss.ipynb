    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an injection attack where hackers deliver a JavaScript payload to execute malicious code whenever someone visits a website. These types of attacks are common on websites that have message boards or comments. There are three types of XSS attacks.\n",

    "\n",
    "<strong>Reflected XSS</strong> is where JavaScript is injected through an HTTP request. A website that uses CGI (Common Gateway Interface) retrieves parameters through the address bar of a browser. A reflected XSS attack injects HTML or JavaScript into an HTTP request, then tampers with the page that gets rendered to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example from <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting\">PortSwigger</a>: \n",
    "\n",
    "```https://insecure-website.com/status?message=<script>/*+Bad+stuff+here...+*/</script>```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the site is accessed, it will render: ```<p>Status: <script>/* Bad stuff here... */</script></p>```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```<script>``` tag will execute any JavaScript code that the hacker wishes to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Stored XSS</strong> is an attack where injected JavaScript is stored on a website by an attacker. For this lab, you will be working with stored XSS payloads. When message boards don't sanitize a user's input, a hacker can write an attack containing ```<script>```, which gets executed whenever that webpage is visited by anyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>DOM-Based XSS</strong> is an attack similar to reflected XSS attacks, but does not utilize HTTP requests when delivering the payload. Rather than using CGI parameters, a DOM-Based attack does not send data to the server, and the attack is entirely client-side. These attacks are difficult to differentiate from reflected XSS attacks. \n",

    "<strong>This lab will contain three topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",

    "## <strong>Topic 1: PHP Sessions, HTTP Protocols, and ```document.cookie```</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>PHP Sessions</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "PHP is a server-side language that's used in web development. PHP is responsible for back-end development, which consists of handling SQL queries for databases, transactions for businesses, image editing, saving data to a storage container, and much more. For this lab, we are focusing on some important concepts used for handling user information, which are sessions and cookies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Sessions</strong> are stored on a server, which expire when the browser is closed. Sessions are usually safer, and store content for less time. However, they do not make you invulnerable, which you will discover later in the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Cookies</strong> are stored on the client's browser, which have a set expiration time. Cookies are stored as text files, which the browser retrieves when a website requests them. You may look up where your cookies are stored by your browser, as well as their contents. A hacker can retrieve cookies no different from how you retrieve them. \n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Side note:</em> The European Union requires websites to be GDPR compliant if they use cookies, which is one of the most strict privacy and security laws in the world. If you are interested in reading more about cookies and the GDPR regulation, you may read more <a href=\"https://gdpr.eu/cookies/\">here</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clear that cookies are not meant to store private data. The safer alternative to cookies are sessions. Cookies can still be used for storing data that's meant to be public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sessions and cookies are global variables that are used in PHP, meaning they're usable across all PHP files. They are called with either ```$_SESSION[\"key\"] = value;``` or ```$_COOKIE[\"key\"] = value;```. Before sessions can be used in PHP, a session must be started. Whenever a ```$_SESSION``` variable is used in PHP, you must call ```session_start()``` before the ```$_SESSION``` variable can be used. Sessions can be manually ended by using ```session_destroy()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>HTTP Protocols</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "An HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request is a method of sending information across website pages. We are going to look at ```POST``` and ```GET``` requests for this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>```POST```</strong> request consists of sending data to a website, to which it becomes processed by the server. ```POST``` should not be confused with ```PUT```, where ```PUT``` is mainly used for replacing or updating a certain resource on a server. ```PUT``` requires a specific Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), meaning you must specify the exact path and resource that you want to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common use of a ```POST``` request is submitting a form on a website. The website identifies specific names for each field, like name, email, or an \"accept\" checkbox. Then, when the user ```POST```s the information by clicking submit, the server assigns those names with specific values that the user provided on the form, then processes the information, like adding the values to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A <strong>```GET```</strong> request gathers a resource from a server. ```GET``` variables are easy to determine from a PHP website, as they appear in the URL of a website. A ```GET``` variable can be obtained by observing a ```?``` after a ```.php``` extension in the URL, then each subsequent name with a ```=``` is the name and value of each ```GET``` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example: ```https://www.testwebsite.com/index.php?name=umdsecXX&age=21```, where ```name``` is umdsecXX and ```age``` is 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ```telnet``` installed, you can call a ```GET``` request for the landing page of any website. Simply type ```telnet url 443``` to call an HTTPS request for any provided URL, then type ```GET /``` to get the HTML source code for the landing page of the website.\n",
