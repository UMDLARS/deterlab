    "# <strong>Pathname Attacks</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pathname attacks, also known as directory traversal attacks, are exploits that allow an attacker to view files that are not stored within the web server's root directory. Websites contain files written in languages like PHP or HTML, which are served from a directory on the web server. For example, when you visit a website hosted through Apache, the web files are typically stored in ```/var/www/html```. If you access a website with the URL ```https://www.yourwebsite.com/index.php```, the ```index.php``` file is served from ```/var/www/html/index.php```. Similarly, images on the website might be stored in ```/var/www/html/images```, so an image file could be served from ```/var/www/html/images/image_1.png```.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Linux, a pathname containing double dots (```..```) refers to the parent directory, which is one level up in the directory hierarchy. Therefore, ```/var/www/html/images/..``` and ```/var/www/html``` refer to the same directory, since ```..``` navigates up from ```images/``` to its parent directory, which is ```html```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web servers should restrict access to files within the web root directory to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files. However, if a web server improperly validates user input, an attacker can craft a URL that includes directory traversal sequences to access files outside the web root. For example, an attacker might attempt to access ```/etc/passwd``` by requesting a URL like ```https://www.yourwebsite.com/index.php?file=../../../etc/passwd```.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if a website has a vulnerability and allows traversal outside the web root, an attacker could access files like ```/etc/passwd```, which contains every user's account information on the server. Hackers can also view files in a user's home directory, such as ```/home/USERNAME_GOES_HERE/example_pic_1.jpg```. If Apache has access to these files, they can be displayed on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows a pathname attack, where an attacker can \"guess\" the location of sensitive files and trick the server into reading and displaying their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>This lab will contain three topics, and you will learn the following:</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to Flask\n",
    "2. Path Canonicalization\n",
    "3. Performing a Pathname Attack"

    "\n",
    "Many options exist for developing a web server, making it difficult to find a \"best\" language and framework for this lab. Other notebooks that are developed for this course mainly use PHP, which is easy to understand and is great with teaching security practices. However, to provide more experience with programming languages and frameworks, this notebook is going to introduce <strong>Flask</strong> for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Flask</strong> is a web framework in Python. Note that Flask’s built-in server is <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63201661/why-should-i-switch-to-a-flask-production-deployment-instead-of-a-development-se\">not suitable for production as it doesn’t scale well.</a> Flask is perfectly suitable for this notebook's needs: It's lightweight, it handles a small amount of requests, and it's designed to be quick and easy to start web applications. Flask is often more used for prototypes before being rolled out for production. If you wish to apply skills that you're learning from this lab, consider using Gunicorn (Green Unicorn), which can be used in conjunction with Flask. In fact, <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/deploying/gunicorn/\">Gunicorn is part of Flask's documentation</a>. If you're interested with learning the differences between the two, check out <a href=\"https://stackshare.io/stackups/flask-vs-gunicorn\">this article</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "When rolling out a large application that's developed in Flask, Gunicorn saves a lot of time and work with transitioning it from a Flask prototype to a large-scale web application. This is a basic summary of how Flask applications are transitioned into a large-scale app:\n",
    "- Install Gunicorn\n",
    "- Run a Gunicorn command that sets the amount of processes, IP, and the name of your Flask application.\n",
    "- Create a ```systemd``` service file that makes the program run continuously in the background.\n",

    "\n",
    "This step is not graded, but it is <strong>incredibly important</strong> for you to follow in order to access this lab. <strong>Accessing this lab is different from the other labs in these notebooks.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Here's a quick start to accessing the lab:</u>\n",
    "- After you have ran the setup from <a href=\"port-forwarding-setup.ipynb\">the port forwarding process</a>, type the following command into your <u>own device's</u> terminal: ```ssh -L 5000:127.0.0.1:5001 USERNAME_GOES_HERE-xdc-USERNAME_GOES_HERE```.\n",
    "- <u>From your local terminal OR your XDC</u>, log into your ```pathname``` node by typing the following command: ```ssh -L 5001:127.0.0.1:5000 pathname```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <strong>Optional reading below</strong> - What is this doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask automatically uses port 5000 on your ```pathname``` node. Additionally, it uses the IP address ```127.0.0.1```, which is the localhost IP address for ```pathname```. Unfortunately, this makes the port forwarding process complex for the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access this lab, using ```ssh pathname``` <em>will</em> work, but you will need to forward from port 5000 to 5001 either on your local machine, or on your XDC. You will need to introduce a \"jump\". Take look at this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ssh -L 5001:127.0.0.1:5000 pathname```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will sign you into the node, but the ```-L``` flag means \"local\", since you are going to be opening a local port. After this flag, ```5001:127.0.0.1:5000``` means that you're going to take the resources hosted on ```127.0.0.1:5000```, then \"wire\" it to your local machine on port ```5001```. Which, in this case, is ```USERNAME_GOES_HERE@xdc```. This makes all resources that are hosted on port ```5000``` accessible on port ```5001```. You may test this by opening another terminal, then type ```curl localhost 5001```, which will print the output of your webpage as HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, when using this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ssh -L 5000:127.0.0.1:5001 USERNAME_GOES_HERE-xdc-USERNAME_GOES_HERE```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are doing the same process as above. Now, the machine that you will access is ```USERNAME_GOES_HERE-xdc-USERNAME_GOES_HERE```, which is your XDC that you're doing this notebook and lab within. Similarly, you are taking the materials hosted on ```127.0.0.1:5001```, then you're hosting it on your local machine (your device) on port ```5000```.\n",

    "For this step, use the ```redirect()``` command to redirect the user to `/` after <u>adding or deleting</u> a memo. The line of code that you need to change is provided to you in the file.

Using ```url_for()``` is good practice, because if you change the location that your URL route points to, it will always refer to the updated URL, because it points to the function. If you struggle to understand this, think of it this way: ```url_for()``` is the \"URL for your function\". If ```def foo():``` has the route ```@app.route(\"/home/foo/foo.html\")```, you can change the URL inside of this route, and the redirect will not need to be changed.\n",
    "- Using ```redirect()``` should be fairly straightforward to implement. However, your notebook will be using this command to make sure that your redirect is working: ```curl POST -d \"memo=test\" -v http://127.0.0.1:5000/add_memo```. Feel free to try using this command in a second terminal, while your first terminal is hosting the server.\n",
    "  - The answer that you use should be the same for ```add_memo()``` and ```delete_memo()```. The ```curl``` command above won't work for ```delete_memo()``` because there are currently no memos on the website yet."

    "  - Write the file into the ```templates/memo/``` directory.\n",

    "  - Take the ID of the memo and concatenate it with the ```memos/``` path.\n",
    "  - Take the file path, then read the memo.\n",
